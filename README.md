# Ayaura

### Ayaura is an Ai Image generator app built on DALL-E with the help of chat-GPT, You need to only imagine and let the magic happens ðŸ˜‰.
### It's a funny app where you enter text and the Ai transforms it into a pic, there's a gallery where you can find all of the others' imaginations, fortunately the name of the artist is not takken so have fun ðŸ˜‚.

## How to try the App

You can install "expo client" from the app store and try the hosted version here : https://expo.dev/@momen_gharib/Ayaura?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go.

## How to install it locally
- This project uses node.js so if you don't have it yet, you can install node.js from here first : [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Then head to the directory you want to store the app, open the terminal and follow these instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/MomenGharib1/Ayaura.git.
cd client
npm install
npm start
Enter "a" to open it in android studio simulator.
Enter "w" to open it as a web application (not recommended)
```
- open a new terminal

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
- Now your default browser will open and you wiil see home page.
- It may takes max 20s to generate the pic, max 30s to load all the pics in the gallery.
- any violated prompts are not accepted and the Ai won't generate the pic.
